## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've improved my skills about Flexbox and disposition in CSS.

### Continued development

The duration of this project was way smaller in matter of times than the project before. Also, I don't feel that exhausted. I've improved, but I think I need to be definitely better at handling HTML & CSS before moving to JavaScript.
I'll create two more projects before moving on.
